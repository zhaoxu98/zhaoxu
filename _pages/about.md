<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University.

I experienced some health setbacks over the past two years, which led to me slowing down my studies. During that period, I receive much help from many people: Prof. Yong Li, Prof. Minghua Chen, Dr. Jie Feng, Dr. Yuanwei Fang, and Kai Zhao. I am very grateful to them and hope to have the opportunity to cooperate with them in the future. Although these setbacks occurred, I am now ready to move forward and make the most of each day.

My research interests include Data-efficient Deep Learning and Multimodal Learning. I am familiar with common machine learning algorithms and deep learning models. I am passionate about discovering new ways to use AI to improve the world we live in. Recently, I am mainly working on data-driven mahjong game AI.
