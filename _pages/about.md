<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I obtained my Bachelor degree in Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, 2022.

I experienced some health setbacks over the past two years, which led to me slowing down my studies. Although these setbacks occurred, I am now ready to move forward and make the most of each day.

Recently, I am mainly working on data-driven mahjong game AI.

Research Interest

My research interests include Data-efficient Deep Learning and Multimodal Learning. 

I am familiar with the common machine learning algorithms and deep learning models. I am passionate about discovering new ways to use AI to improve the world we live in.
