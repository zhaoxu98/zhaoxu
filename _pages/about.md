<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I graduated from the department of [Electronic Engineering][A2] at [Tsinghua University][A1] <img src='./images/Tsinghua_University_Logo.svg' style='width: 3em;'>, a university that ranked #14 globally and #1 in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

Despite facing health setbacks over the past two years, I persevered with the support of my professors, including Prof. Yong Li and Prof. Minghua Chen, as well as Dr. Jie Feng, Dr. Yuanwei Fang, and Kai Zhao. I am deeply grateful for their help and look forward to collaborating with them in the future. Although I faced challenges, I remained focused and motivated to move forward and make the most of each day.

**My research interests** include Spatio-Temporal Data Mining, Graph Learning and Deep Learning. I am proficient in common machine learning algorithms and deep learning models and passionate about leveraging AI to improve our world.

_In the past, I've let go of many golden opportunities and often regretted those decisions. However, looking back, I feel grateful to every person who trusted me. Now, when presented with new opportunities, I vow to cherish them wholeheartedly and honor all commitments, no matter their size._
