<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I graduated from Tsinghua University with a bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering.

Despite facing health setbacks over the past two years, I persevered with the support of my professors, including Prof. Yong Li and Prof. Minghua Chen, as well as Dr. Jie Feng, Dr. Yuanwei Fang, and Kai Zhao. I am deeply grateful for their help and look forward to collaborating with them in the future. Although I faced challenges, I remained focused and motivated to move forward and make the most of each day.

My research interests include Data-efficient Deep Learning and Data Mining. I am proficient in common machine learning algorithms and deep learning models and passionate about leveraging AI to improve our world. Currently, I am developing data-driven AI for mahjong games.
