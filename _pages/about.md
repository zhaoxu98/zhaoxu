# 💬 For Prospective Advisor

<details markdown='1'><summary>Details</summary>

## English Version

I plan to apply for Ph.D. programs for Fall 2025. Here are a few expectations I have for my future advisor and collaborators:

1. <span style="color: #8C6804;">Interest</span>: My motivation is fueled by my passions, and working on projects that don't spark my interest is a challenge I prefer to avoid. It's crucial for me to find a research group where our interests align, as this is a fundamental requirement for me.
2. <span style="color: #8C6804;">Qualities</span>: I strive to uphold values of integrity, diligence, and responsibility, and I seek to work alongside individuals who share these commendable traits.
3. <span style="color: #8C6804;">Atmosphere</span>: A positive team environment significantly boosts my motivation and productivity. This is a key reason why I chose to join USAIL.
The importance of the above factors is ranked as follows: 1 = 2 > 3 >> others.

Recently, I wrote a blog in Chinese, detailing my expectations for Ph.D. applications, future research, and life. You're welcome to read it: [24#00 Before Applying][F1]

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email (zhaohsu98@gmail.com), phone (+86-13260261866), or WeChat (Bill2998).

## Chinese Version

我计划申请 25Fall 入学的 Ph.D. 项目，以下几点是我对未来的导师与合作者的期待：

1. 兴趣：我一直是一个兴趣导向的人，我无法忍受做完全不感兴趣的事情，相近的研究兴趣是必要条件。
2. 品质：我以诚信、勤奋、责任心等准则要求自己，所以我也希望能与具有类似优秀品质的人合作。
3. 氛围：在拥有一个良好氛围的团队中，我会有更高的自我驱动和执行力 (这是我加入 USAIL 的一个重要原因)。
以上几点的重要程度：1 = 2 > 3 >> 其他

最近我写了一篇中文博客，更详细地介绍了我对 PhD 申请、未来的研究与生活的期待，欢迎阅读：[24#00 写在申请前][F1]

最后，感谢您愿意花时间来了解我，如果您对我有任何意见和建议，欢迎通过邮件 (zhaohsu98@gmail.com)、电话 (+86-13260261866) 或微信 (Bill2998) 联系我。

   <details markdown='1'><summary>Know More About Me in 1 Minute</summary>

   1. 我一直是一个兴趣导向的人，我无法忍受做完全不感兴趣（*例如模拟电路*）的事情，同时我对新知识和新领域的挑战非常感兴趣且具备足够的行动力（*例如，尽管我不喜欢模拟电路，但我对芯片设计很感兴趣，所以在本科期间我熟练 Verilog 语言后，自己选修了微电子的研究生课程，了解并实践了芯片设计的完整流程，完成了一个简单卷积神经网络加速芯片的版图设计*）。
   2. 我患有较为严重的腰椎间盘突出疾病，并曾因病影响了两年的学习时间。尽管腰椎疾病是不可逆的，通过坚持康复训练和定期游泳等方式，目前疾病已经不会影响到我正常的生活和工作。
   3. 生病期间，我在病痛中花了很长时间思考对人生的规划，确定了真正的兴趣，对未来的期待是我战胜疾病的一个重要原因。这也使我决定将有限的时间投入到感兴趣的领域，也是我决定读 PhD 的原因。我是一个终身学习者，也是“日拱一卒”想法的践行者。尽管由于之前生病耽误了很多时间，但我从康复以来一直（努力:）保持对时间的高效利用和对自身的有效管理，我有信心在接下来几年内赶上并超过先行者。
