<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I graduated from the department of [Electronic Engineering][A2] at [Tsinghua University][A1] <img src='./images/Tsinghua_University_Logo.svg' style='width: 3em;'>, a university that ranked #14 globally and #1 in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

Despite facing health setbacks over the past two years, I persevered with the support of my professors, including [Prof. Yong Li][A3] and [Prof. Minghua Chen][A4], as well as [Dr. Jie Feng][A5], Dr. Yuanwei Fang, and Kai Zhao. I am deeply grateful for their help and look forward to collaborating with them in the future. Although I faced challenges, I remained focused and motivated to move forward and make the most of each day.

**My research interests** include Spatio-Temporal Data Mining, Graph Learning and Deep Learning. I am proficient in common machine learning algorithms and deep learning models and passionate about leveraging AI to improve our world.

<blockquote class="blockquote-center"><center>Genius only means hard-working all one's life. (Mendeleyer)</center></blockquote>

_In the past, I've let go of many golden opportunities and often regretted those decisions. However, looking back, I feel grateful to every person who trusted me. Now, when presented with new opportunities, I vow to cherish them wholeheartedly and honor all commitments, no matter their size._

# 💬 To Prospective Supervisor and Mentor

<details markdown='1'><summary>Details</summary>
Since my recovery, I have been searching for internship/research opportunities. I plan to apply for graduate programs in the 24Spring&Fall and would like to gain experience in either academic research or industry internships beforehand. This would allow me to focus on my interests earlier and improve my research and coding abilities. Here are my expectations for internships and research opportunities. If you meet the description and are interested in interviewing me after reviewing my background, please feel free to contact me.

1. I have always been interest-driven and cannot tolerate doing something that does not interest me (*such as Analog Electronics*). However, I am highly interested in new knowledge and challenges in new fields and possess enough initiative to take action (*for example, even though I do not enjoy studying Analog Electronics, I am interested in chip design. Therefore, during my undergraduate studies, I became proficient in Verilog and took graduate courses in microelectronics, familiarizing myself with the entire chip design process and designing a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Accelerator Chip*). <font color="red"><b>Currently, my main research interest is spatiotemporal data mining, utilizing the deep learning algorithms, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning algorithms to solve problems related to smart cities.</b></font>

2. During my illness, I spent a long time thinking about life planning while suffering from pain. I identified my genuine interests and expectations for the future, which was a crucial factor in my triumph over my illness. It also led me to commit to investing my limited time in fields that interest me, which is why I decided to pursue graduate studies. I am a lifelong learner and practitioner of the "Inch by inch, life's a cinch" idea. Although my illness previously consumed much of my time, I have been highly efficient with my time since recovering and am confident that I will catch up with and surpass my peers in the coming years. Currently, I dedicate about one hour each day to exercise, eight to ten hours to studying professional knowledge, two hours to learning about new subjects in fields different from computer science (like history, economics, and piano), and one hour to sharing life with families and friends.

3. I need opportunities to prove myself, and I am extremely grateful to anyone willing to trust my abilities and offer me opportunities. If I contacted you first, it means that I have researched your previous work and am interested in collaborating with you. You can refer to my latest resume <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19sGyJEnMpCdhibr1cWjDAB5-FCyhVS_-/view" title="Resume"><b>HERE</b></a> to decide whether to grant me an interview opportunity. If I have yet to contact you, it does not necessarily mean that I am not interested in your work. It could be that I have yet to have the chance to contact you or want to improve my skills before collaborating with you. However, I welcome you to contact me proactively, and I will provide feedback as soon as I thoroughly understand your work.

Finally, thank you for taking the time to learn about me. If you have any feedback or suggestions, don't hesitate to get in touch with me by email(zhaohsu98@gmail.com), phone(+86-13260261866), or WeChat(Bill2998).

# 💬 致潜在的导师和主管

<details markdown='1'><summary>展开/收起</summary>
自康复以来，我一直在寻找实习/科研的机会。我计划申请 24Spring&Fall 入学的研究生项目，在此之前我渴望获得在学术界科研或者业界实习的机会，从而能让我提前专注在喜欢的方向上，也能锻炼自己的科研和代码能力。以下几点是我对实习和科研的期待，如果您符合下面的情况或者在了解我的背景后，愿意给我一次面试的机会，欢迎立刻联系我。

1. 我一直是一个兴趣导向的人，我无法忍受做完全不感兴趣（*例如模拟电路*）的事情，同时我对新知识和新领域的挑战非常感兴趣且具备足够的行动力（*例如，尽管我不喜欢模拟电路，但我对芯片设计很感兴趣，所以在本科期间我熟练 Verilog 语言后，自己选修了微电子的研究生课程，了解并实践了芯片设计的完整流程，完成了一个简单卷积神经网络加速芯片的版图设计*）。<font color="red"><b>目前，我的主要研究兴趣是时空数据挖掘，通过利用深度学习算法、图神经网络和强化学习算法解决与智慧城市相关的问题。</b></font>

2. 生病期间，我在病痛中花了很长时间思考对人生的规划，确定了真正的兴趣，对未来的期待是我战胜疾病的一个重要原因。这也使我决定将有限的时间投入到感兴趣的领域，也是我决定读研的原因。我是一个终身学习者，也是“日拱一卒”想法的践行者。尽管由于之前生病耽误了很多时间，但我从康复以来一直保持对时间的高效利用和对自身的有效管理，我有信心在接下来几年内赶上并超过先行者。目前，我坚持每天分配约 1 小时用来锻炼身体，8 至 10 小时用来学习专业知识，2 小时用来学习其他领域的新事物，以及 1 个小时与家人和朋友分享生活。

3. 目前我很需要证明自己的机会，我非常感激每一位愿意信任我的能力，提供机会给我的人。假如您是我主动联系的，这一定意味着我对您过往工作进行了调研，而且也对与您合作的机会感兴趣。您可以在<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19sGyJEnMpCdhibr1cWjDAB5-FCyhVS_-/view" title="个人简历"><b>这里</b></a>参考我的最新简历，决定是否给予我面试机会。如果我之前未联系过您，这并不意味我对您的工作不感兴趣，可能是我还没来得及或者是希望努力提升自己能力后再与您合作。但我同样欢迎您积极联系我，我会在详细了解您的工作后及时给您反馈。

最后，感谢您愿意花时间来了解我，如果您对我有任何意见和建议，欢迎通过邮件 (zhaohsu98@gmail.com)、电话 (+86-13260261866) 或微信 (Bill2998) 联系我。
